## **Foundational Principles**

Neddism represents a synthetic socioeconomic philosophy that seeks to harmonize four major political traditions:

- **Socialism:** Emphasis on collective ownership and equitable outcomes
- **Democracy:** Commitment to voluntary consent and participatory decision-making
- **Anarchy:** Maximization of individual autonomy and minimization of coercive hierarchy
- **Capitalism:** Recognition of personal management and incentive structures

**Core Philosophy:** Neddism operates on the principle of *"Maximum liberty through minimum necessary restriction,"* where social harmony emerges not from enforced conformity but from respect for mutually-agreed boundaries.

## **Social Doctrine: The Six Pillars**

### **Pillar 1: The Liberty Principle**
> "Every citizen can do anything, as long as it does not sabotage or interfere with anyone else in any harmful way unless voluntary consent is obtained from every affected party, or a universally agreeable valid reason exists."

**Interpretation:** This establishes a harm-based boundary for action rather than morality-based legislation. The burden of proof rests on demonstrating harm, not on prohibiting actions deemed undesirable by majority opinion. "Voluntary consent" requires informed agreement without coercion.

### **Pillar 2: The Proportional Defense Principle**
> "Every citizen has the right to self-defense. The permissible force is limited to a level below or equal to the force the attacker attempted to use."

**Interpretation:** This creates a clear escalation ladder preventing excessive retaliation while maintaining individual security. The principle acknowledges defensive rights while curbing vengeance cycles.

### **Pillar 3: The Resistance Principle**
> "Every citizen has the right to stand against any individual, group, or institution that seeks to violate their freedom and rights."

**Interpretation:** Legitimizes civil disobedience and resistance against unjust authority. No institution is granted immunity from accountability.

### **Pillar 4: The Justice Synthesis**
> "Justice must be administered as a synthesis of global respect (dignity for all persons) and global fairness (equitable outcomes and opportunities across society)."

**Interpretation:** Justice serves dual purposes: restorative (respecting human dignity) and distributive (ensuring societal fairness). This bridges retributive and restorative justice models.

### **Pillar 5: The Anti-Coercion Principle**
> "No citizen may be compelled to do anything or go anywhere against their will, unless there exists a valid reason that the affected individual can themselves agree is justified."

**Interpretation:** Coercion requires not just objective justification but *subjective understanding*. The standard is whether the coerced individual, when properly informed, would acknowledge the necessity.

### **Pillar 6: The Action-Result Focus**
> "What counts aren't thoughts and insults, but physical action, the process, and the result."

**Interpretation:** Neddism distinguishes between offensive speech and harmful action. While social consequences may follow offensive speech, only harmful actions trigger formal sanctions.

## **Economic Frameworks**

Neddism recognizes two compatible economic models, applicable based on community choice and individual circumstances:

### **The Dual-System Approach**
1. **Publoneddism:** For communities choosing collective ownership
2. **Selfoneddism:** For individuals operating outside collective communities

Both systems share fundamental Neddist values but differ in resource allocation mechanisms.

---

## **Publoneddism: Community-Based Model**

### **Definition**
Publoneddism is a system where the entire Neddist community holds collective ownership of major resources and means of production, comparable to Market Socialism but with enhanced individual usage rights.

### **Core Principles**
- **Collective Ownership:** Land, healthcare infrastructure, educational institutions, and major industries are owned by the community as a whole
- **Usage Rights:** Individuals or groups may use resources with permission from the "formal owner" (the person or entity that would own it under traditional property systems)
- **Stewardship Model:** Resources are managed by elected or appointed stewards accountable to the community
- **Market Mechanisms:** While ownership is collective, distribution often operates through modified market systems

### **Resource Access Framework**
1. **Personal Use:** Granted upon reasonable request
2. **Commercial Use:** Requires community approval and revenue sharing
3. **Essential Services:** Healthcare, education, and basic utilities operate on need-based access
4. **Dispute Resolution:** Community boards mediate conflicting usage claims

### **Economic Structure**
- **Currency:** Community currencies or labor credits often supplement traditional money
- **Production:** Worker cooperatives and community enterprises dominate
- **Distribution:** Mixed system combining need-based allocation for essentials and market-based for non-essentials
- **Investment:** Community-controlled investment funds finance new ventures

---

## **Selfoneddism: Individual-Based Model**

### **Definition**
Selfoneddism applies Neddist principles to individuals living outside collective communities, emphasizing personal financial management within an ethical framework.

### **Core Principles**
- **Individual Ownership:** Personal property and resources are owned individually
- **Financial Autonomy:** Complete control over personal finances
- **Ethical Framework:** Financial decisions guided by Neddist social principles
- **Community Optional:** Engagement with Neddist communities is voluntary

### **The 70-85% Principle (Traditional Method)**
```
Income Allocation:
├── 70-85% → Savings & Necessities
│   ├── Emergency fund (6-12 months expenses)
│   ├── Long-term investments
│   ├── Essential expenses (housing, food, healthcare)
│   └── Used only when 100% necessary
└── 15-30% → Discretionary Spending
    ├── Personal enjoyment
    ├── Charitable giving (voluntary)
    ├── Skill development
    └── Community support (if chosen)
```

### **Variations & Flexibility**
- **Strict Selfoneddism:** Adheres precisely to the 70-85% savings principle
- **Flexible Selfoneddism:** Maintains the savings ethos without rigid percentage adherence
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Partially participates in Publoneddist communities while maintaining separate finances

### **Integration with Broader Society**
Selfoneddists may participate in conventional economies while:
1. Avoiding businesses that violate Neddist principles
2. Seeking voluntary, transparent transactions
3. Prioritizing self-sufficiency and financial resilience
4. Optionally contributing to Neddist communities through voluntary support

## **Governance & Justice**

### **Decision-Making Structures**
- **Consent-Based Governance:** No decision affecting individuals without their consent
- **Subsidiarity Principle:** Decisions made at the most local level possible
- **Rotating Leadership:** Positions of authority are temporary and rotational
- **Transparent Deliberation:** All governance discussions accessible to community members

### **Justice System**
- **Restorative Focus:** Prioritizes repairing harm over punishment
- **Community Juries:** Peers decide cases with emphasis on Pillar 4 (respect and fairness)
- **No Professional Police:** Community defense handled through rotating citizen duty or voluntary professional services
- **Rehabilitation Emphasis:** Incapacitation only for immediate threats; otherwise focus on rehabilitation

### **Conflict Resolution**
1. **Direct Dialogue:** Parties attempt resolution themselves
2. **Mediation:** Community facilitators assist if direct dialogue fails
3. **Arbitration:** Binding decisions by mutually-agreed arbitrators
4. **Community Assembly:** For significant conflicts affecting the broader community

---

## **Implementation & Transition**

### **Phased Implementation**
**Phase 1: Community Formation**
- Small voluntary communities establish Neddist principles
- Develop conflict resolution mechanisms
- Create economic sharing agreements

**Phase 2: Parallel Institutions**
- Neddist schools, healthcare, and dispute systems operate alongside traditional institutions
- Demonstrate viability of Neddist approaches

**Phase 3: Gradual Integration**
- Voluntary adoption by broader society
- Hybrid systems allowing choice between Neddist and traditional approaches

### **Transition Challenges & Solutions**
- **Property Rights:** Gradual transition through purchase, gift, or inheritance
- **Security Concerns:** Voluntary defense associations and proportional response protocols
- **Economic Integration:** Dual-currency systems and convertible labor credits
- **Legal Recognition:** Treating Neddist communities as special jurisdiction zones

---

### **Internal Debates**
- **Rigidity vs Flexibility:** How strictly to interpret the six pillars
- **Integration vs Separation:** Degree of engagement with non-Neddist societies
- **Expansion vs Preservation:** Whether to actively grow Neddist communities or maintain small, tight-knit groups

---

## **Conclusion: The Neddist Vision**

Neddism represents not a utopian endpoint but a continuous process of balancing:
- **Individual autonomy** with **social responsibility**
- **Spontaneous order** with **intentional design**
- **Local control** with **global fairness**

### **The Living Philosophy**
As founder Evan Allen envisioned, Neddism remains adaptable to changing circumstances while maintaining its core commitment to voluntary cooperation, proportional response, and respect for human dignity.

### **Invitation to Practice**
Neddism invites individuals to:
1. Apply its principles in personal life (Selfoneddism)
2. Join communities practicing collective ownership (Publoneddism)
3. Hybridize approaches based on personal circumstances
4. Continuously refine the philosophy through practice and dialogue

### **Final Principle**
> "Neddism can be seen as a compass pointing toward greater liberty through greater responsibility, stronger community through stronger individuals, and deeper justice through deeper understanding."
