# Neddism: A Political and Moral Philosophy

**Founder:** Pietro Evan Scandale
**Year of Formalization:** 2026  
**Inspired by:** A synthesis of radical individual sovereignty, consent-based ethics, and global egalitarian justice.

## Core Principles (The Five Pillars)

Neddism is built upon five fundamental axioms, intended as the inviolable foundation of a just society.

### 1. The Principle of Non-Interference
> Every citizen can do anything, as long as it does not sabotage or interfere with anyone else in any harmful way (e.g., stealing, bullying) **unless** voluntary consent is obtained from every affected party, or a universally agreeable valid reason exists.

### 2. The Principle of Proportional Self-Defense
> Every citizen has the right to self-defense. The permissible force is limited to a level **below or equal to** the force the attacker attempted to use.

### 3. The Principle of Defensive Resistance
> Every citizen has the right to stand against any individual, group, or institution that seeks to violate their freedom and rights.

### 4. The Principle of Global Justice
> Justice must be administered as a synthesis of **global respect** (dignity for all persons) and **global fairness** (equitable outcomes and opportunities across society).

### 5. The Principle of Voluntary Association
> No citizen may be compelled to do anything or go anywhere against their will, **unless** there exists a valid reason that the affected individual can themselves agree is justified (e.g., a child understands the necessity of a dentist visit after explanation).

## Philosophical Foundations

Neddism is not merely an economic program, but a **meta-ethical framework** for human interaction. It prioritizes:

*   **Sovereign Individual Autonomy:** The individual is the fundamental unit of moral agency. Coercion is the primary social evil.
*   **Consent as the Basis of Legitimacy:** Any authority, rule, or collective action that impacts others must derive its legitimacy from the consent of those affected.
*   **Justice as Fairness and Dignity:** A good society is measured not only by the freedom it protects but by the dignity and equitable standing it affords to all members.

## Economic Implications

Neddism does not prescribe a single economic system. Instead, it sets the **ethical constraints** within which any economy must operate:

*   Any economic model (market-based, cooperative, mixed) is permissible **only if** it does not violate the Five Pillars.
*   It is compatible with **Market Socialism** if worker cooperatives and social ownership arise voluntarily and operate without coercive exploitation.
*   It is equally compatible with a **radical libertarian** economy if that economy can ensure global fairness and respect without coercion—a key tension and area for development within the ideology.
*   Exploitation, poverty imposed by systemic force, and economic coercion are viewed as violations of Pillars 1 and 4.

## Governance and Social Order

*   The ideal governing structure is one that **minimizes or eliminates initiatory coercion** while upholding Pillar 4 (Global Justice).
*   This suggests a possible model of a **minimal, consensually-funded state** whose sole mandate is to protect the Five Pillars, or a **non-state, contractual legal order** built on unanimous community agreement.
*   Law and conflict resolution must aim for restorative and proportional outcomes (Pillars 2 & 4).

## Tensions and Areas for Development

Neddism embraces its internal philosophical challenges as points for dialogue:

1.  **The Fairness-Coercion Dilemma:** How does a society achieve "global fairness" (Pillar 4) without ever employing coercion (Pillar 1 & 5), especially toward those who benefit from inequality?
2.  **Scale and Consent:** How are "valid reasons" and "voluntary consent" defined and operationalized in large, complex societies?
3.  **Enforcement of Justice:** Who arbitrates and upholds the Pillars, and by what authority (derived from consent)?

## Relation to Other Ideologies

*   **Libertarianism:** Shares the absolute commitment to non-aggression and self-ownership, but Neddism explicitly incorporates a positive obligation toward global fairness.
*   **Socialism:** Shares the goal of eliminating exploitation and ensuring fairness, but Neddism demands that all means toward that end be strictly consensual.
*   **Classical Liberalism:** Shares a focus on liberty and justice, but Neddism's principles are more absolute and its conception of justice is explicitly both procedural (consent) and outcome-oriented (fairness).
*   **Market Socialism:** A possible *economic expression* of Neddism, **but only if** implemented in a way fully compliant with the Five Pillars.

## Invitation for Discussion

Neddism is presented not as a finished doctrine, but as an **open framework**. Pietro (Evan) invites philosophers, political thinkers, and interested individuals to engage with these principles, critique them, explore their implications, and help develop the applications of this ideology.

**The central question of Neddism is:** *Can we build a world of both perfect freedom and perfect fairness, and if so, how?*

*   **Propose applications** (legal, economic, social).
*   **Explore historical or contemporary societies** that reflect these pillars.
*   **Challenge the axioms.**
