# **The Complete Doctrine of Neddism**

*Authored by Evan Allen*

## **I. Philosophical Foundations & Genesis**

Neddism is a synthesized socioeconomic-political ideology born from a critical analysis of four foundational systems: **Socialism** (collective ownership, equity), **Democracy** (popular sovereignty, rights), **Anarchy** (voluntary association, anti-coercion), and **Capitalism** (private initiative, markets). It seeks to harmonize their core valid principles while eliminating their perceived contradictions and failures.

Its ultimate goal is a society of **maximized individual sovereignty within a framework of voluntary, justified cooperation**, where force is never initiated, and all interactions are rooted in consent, merit, and demonstrable necessity.

## **II. The Six Pillars**

The bedrock of Neddist society. These are non-negotiable social axioms.

### **Pillar 1: The Principle of Non-Interference & Justified Exception**
> "Every citizen can do anything, as long as it does not sabotage or interfere with anyone else in any harmful way (e.g., stealing, bullying) unless voluntary consent is obtained from every affected party, or a universally agreeable valid reason exists."

*   **Core:** Absolute negative liberty. Your right to swing your fist ends at another's nose.
*   **The Dual Exception Framework:**
    1.  **Full Consent:** Any potentially interfering action becomes permissible if **every single person** affected provides informed, uncoerced consent. (e.g., a risky community experiment).
    2.  **Valid Reason:** An action causing temporary or necessary interference can be taken if a reason exists that is *objective, necessary for a greater good, and universally agreeable by any rational person* (e.g., restraining a person having a violent mental health crisis to administer aid).

### **Pillar 2: The Principle of Proportional Self-Defense**
> "Every citizen has the right to self-defense. The permissible force is limited to a level below or equal to the force the attacker attempted to use."

*   Defense is a right, not a privilege. However, it is not a license for retribution.
*   The response must be a **measured escalation** focused solely on stopping the aggression. Lethal force is only permissible against a lethal threat.

### **Pillar 3: The Right of Resistance**
> "Every citizen has the right to stand against any individual, group, or institution that seeks to violate their freedom and rights."

*   This legitimizes resistance against tyranny, corruption, or any entity violating Pillar 1. It is the enforcement mechanism of the social contract.

### **Pillar 4: Justice as Global Synthesis**
> "Justice must be administered as a synthesis of global respect (dignity for all persons) and global fairness (equitable outcomes and opportunities across society)."

*   **Global Respect:** Justice must never degrade human dignity (no cruel/unusual punishment, respect for the accused).
*   **Global Fairness:** Outcomes must consider systemic context. Justice seeks to restore not just legal balance, but social and opportunity equity.

### **Pillar 5: The Anti-Compulsion Principle**
> "No citizen may be compelled to do anything or go anywhere against their will, unless there exists a valid reason that the affected individual can themselves agree is justified."

*   The ultimate bar for coercion is incredibly high. The "valid reason" must be explainable and justifiable **to the person being compelled**. This fosters a society of persuasion and reason, not mandate.
*   *Example:* A child cannot be *arbitrarily* forced to the dentist. The parent must explain the necessity of dental health, the consequences of neglect, and the process. The child's understanding and agreement to the justification is required.

### **Pillar 6: Materialist Focus**
> "What counts aren't thoughts and insults, but physical action, the process, and the result."

*   Neddism is concerned with **material reality**, not ideology or speech. Hateful thoughts or offensive speech are not actionable. Only tangible, harmful *actions* (or credible, immediate threats thereof) fall under social sanction. The quality of an outcome is judged by its real-world effects.

## **III. Economic Implementation: The Two Paths**

Neddism branches into two economic systems, chosen by communities or individuals based on preference and context. Both operate under the Six Pillars.

### **A. Publoneddism: The Communitarian Meritocracy**

*   **Analog:** Market Socialism with a strict Meritocratic overlay.
*   **Core Tenet:** The community collectively owns all major means of production, essential resources, and public goods (land, healthcare infrastructure, educational institutions, major industries).
*   **Mechanism of Use:**
    1.  **Stewardship, Not Absolutism:** While collectively owned, resources are managed by "formal owners" (e.g., a farmer stewards a plot of land, a doctor stewards a clinic). They are not absolute owners, but primary custodians.
    2.  **Access Rule:** To use a resource, one must obtain **voluntary permission** from its steward. The steward must grant access if the use aligns with community benefit and the user's merit.
    3.  **The Meritocratic Engine:** **"The more you work hard for the community, the more resources you're allowed to have."**
        *   "Work hard" is quantitatively and qualitatively measured by community contribution (labor, innovation, teaching, art that enriches society).
        *   "Allowed to have" means greater access to community resources: better housing allocations, priority for advanced education, use of community vacation properties, etc.
        *   **Not a Currency:** Merit is not a tradable token; it is a standing that determines your priority and access level within the communal pool.
*   **Society:** Highly cooperative, focused on collective advancement. Inequality exists not in private wealth, but in social capital and access privileges earned through service.

### **B. Selfoneddism: The Sovereign Individual System**

*   **Analog:** Heavily modified Capitalism with a core ethos of radical personal responsibility and financial discipline.
*   **Core Tenet:** The individual is the absolute owner of their labor, property, and capital. They exist either in isolation, in a Selfoneddist community, or as an autonomous unit within a Publoneddist society (with negotiated treaties).
*   **Mechanism of Use:**
    *   Individuals engage in trade, markets, and employment as they see fit, bound only by the Six Pillars (no fraud, coercion, etc.).
    *   The system generates private money and finances.
*   **The Recommended "Traditional Method" (Ethical Framework):**
    > "70-85% goes to save and used if 100% necessary, and the rest goes all for fun."
    *   This is not a law, but a **cultural ideal** of extreme frugality and long-term security.
    *   **The 70-85% (Save/Necessity Pool):** Covers all true necessities (shelter, nutritious food, healthcare, insurance, tools of trade) and, crucially, massive savings. This savings is for existential emergencies, strategic investment in future capability, or as a buffer against compulsion.
    *   **The 15-30% (Fun/Voluntary Allocation):** All discretionary spending. This is for leisure, luxury, gifts, and voluntary charitable acts—the pure expression of personal joy without compromising security.
    *   **Philosophy:** This method ensures the individual is **invulnerable to coercion** (Pillar 5) because they are financially independent. It maximizes future freedom.

## **IV. Political Structure**

A Neddist polity is a **Voluntary Protective Association (VPA)**.
*   Governance is minimalist, existing solely to:
    1.  Uphold and adjudicate the **Six Pillars**.
    2.  Manage communal resources in **Publoneddism**.
    3.  Enforce contracts and defend against external aggression.
*   Leadership is **meritocratic and recallable**. In Publoneddist VPAs, leaders are top contributors. In Selfoneddist VPAs, they may be hired arbitrators or security providers.
*   **Exit is always a right.** Any individual or group may secede from the VPA, taking their rightful property (Selfoneddism) or negotiated share of communal assets (Publoneddism).

## **V. Synthesis & Conclusion**

Neddism presents a dual-path system unified by an uncompromising social code:

*   **Publoneddism** offers a communitarian life where status and comfort are earned through tangible contribution to the collective, eliminating poverty and alienation through shared ownership and merit-based access.
*   **Selfoneddism** offers a sovereign life of radical self-reliance, where financial discipline is the pathway to ultimate freedom, and interaction with others is purely voluntary and market-based.

**The Choice** between them is a choice of social orientation: the collaborative collective or the disciplined sovereign individual. Both are built on the same foundation: **No justified coercion, only voluntary action. No reward without merit. No justice without dignity and fairness.** This is the world Evan Allen systematized: a world where your life is yours, your choices are yours, and your worth is determined by what you do, not what you own or profess.
