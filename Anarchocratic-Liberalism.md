# **The Complete Doctrine of Anarchocratic Liberalism**

*Authored by Evan Allen*

## **I. Philosophical Foundations & Genesis**

Neddism, also known as **Anarchocratic Liberalism**, is a synthesized socioeconomic-political ideology born from a critical analysis of four foundational systems: **Socialism** (collective ownership, equity), **Democracy** (popular sovereignty, rights), **Anarchy** (voluntary association, anti-coercion), and **Capitalism** (private initiative, markets). It seeks to harmonize their core valid principles while eliminating their perceived contradictions and failures.

Its ultimate goal is a society of **maximized individual sovereignty within a framework of voluntary, justified cooperation**, where force is never initiated, and all interactions are rooted in consent, merit, and demonstrable necessity.

## **II. The Six Pillars**

The Six Pillars for the ideal Neddist society

### **Pillar 1: The Principle of Non-Interference & Justified Exception**
> "Every citizen can do anything, as long as it does not sabotage or interfere with anyone else in any harmful way (e.g., stealing, bullying) unless voluntary consent is obtained from every affected party, or a universally agreeable valid reason exists."

*   **Core:** Absolute negative liberty. Your right to swing your fist ends at another's nose.
*   **The Dual Exception Framework:**
    1.  **Full Consent:** Any potentially interfering action becomes permissible if **every single person** affected provides informed, uncoerced consent. (e.g., a risky community experiment).
    2.  **Valid Reason:** An action causing temporary or necessary interference can be taken if a reason exists that is *objective, necessary for a greater good, and universally agreeable by any rational person* (e.g., restraining a person having a violent mental health crisis to administer aid).

### **Pillar 2: The Principle of Proportional Self-Defense**
> "Every citizen has the right to self-defense. The permissible force is limited to a level below or equal to the force the attacker attempted to use."

*   Defense is a right, not a privilege. However, it is not a license for retribution.
*   The response must be a **measured escalation** focused solely on stopping the aggression. Lethal force is only permissible against a lethal threat.

### **Pillar 3: The Right of Resistance**
> "Every citizen has the right to stand against any individual, group, or institution that seeks to violate their freedom and rights."

*   This legitimizes resistance against tyranny, corruption, or any entity violating Pillar 1. It is the enforcement mechanism of the social contract.

### **Pillar 4: Justice as Global Synthesis**
> "Justice must be administered as the extremist mix of global respect and global fairness."

*   **Global Respect:** Justice must never degrade human dignity (no cruel/unusual punishment, respect for the accused).
*   **Global Fairness:** Outcomes must consider systemic context. Justice seeks to restore not just legal balance, but social and opportunity equity.

### **Pillar 5: The Anti-Compulsion Principle**
> "No citizen may be compelled to do anything or go anywhere against their will."

*   The ultimate bar for coercion is incredibly high. The "valid reason" must be explainable and justifiable **to the person being compelled**. This fosters a society of persuasion and reason, not mandate.
*   *Example:* A child cannot be *arbitrarily* forced to the dentist. The parent must explain the necessity of dental health, the consequences of neglect, and the process. The child's understanding and agreement to the justification is required.
*   **Only Exception**: If the action the individual is forced to helps the state, like a mission to discover enemy tactics or participating the special forces, then it all depends on the individual's capabilities.
*   *Example*: A person who has a certain disorder or just isn't built for combat shouldn't be forced in the military, but a person who doesn't have any disorder or difficulty can be forced in the military (or in this case, in a section that must act only for military backup)

### **Pillar 6: Materialist Focus**
> "What counts aren't thoughts and insults, but physical action, the process, and the result."

*   Neddism is concerned with **material reality**, not ideology or speech. Hateful thoughts or offensive speech are not actionable. Only tangible, harmful *actions* (or credible, immediate threats thereof) fall under social sanction. The quality of an outcome is judged by its real-world effects.

## **III. Economic Implementation: The Three Paths**

Neddism branches into three primary economic systems, chosen by communities or individuals based on preference and context. All operate under the Six Pillars.

### **A. Publoneddism: Anarchocratic Communism**

*   **Analog:** Market Socialism with a strict Meritocratic overlay.
*   **Core Tenet:** The community collectively owns all major means of production, essential resources, and public goods (land, healthcare infrastructure, educational institutions, major industries).
*   **Mechanism of Use:**
    1.  **Stewardship, Not Absolutism:** While collectively owned, resources are managed by "formal owners" (e.g., a farmer stewards a plot of land, a doctor stewards a clinic). They are not absolute owners, but primary custodians.
    2.  **Access Rule:** To use a resource, one must obtain **voluntary permission** from its steward. The steward must grant access if the use aligns with community benefit and the user's merit.
    3.  **The Meritocratic Engine:** **"The more you work hard for the community, the more resources you're allowed to have."**
        *   "Work hard" is quantitatively and qualitatively measured by community contribution (labor, innovation, teaching, art that enriches society).
        *   "Allowed to have" means greater access to community resources: better housing allocations, priority for advanced education, use of community vacation properties, etc.
        *   **Not a Currency:** Merit is not a tradable token; it is a standing that determines your priority and access level within the communal pool.
*   **Society:** Highly cooperative, focused on collective advancement. Inequality exists not in private wealth, but in social capital and access privileges earned through service.

### **B. Selfoneddism: Anarchocratic Capitalism**

*   **Analog:** Heavily modified Capitalism with a core ethos of radical personal responsibility and financial discipline.
*   **Core Tenet:** The individual is the absolute owner of their labor, property, and capital. They exist either in isolation, in a Selfoneddist community, or as an autonomous unit within a Publoneddist society (with negotiated treaties).
*   **Mechanism of Use:**
    *   Individuals engage in trade, markets, and employment as they see fit, bound only by the Six Pillars (no fraud, coercion, etc.).
    *   The system generates private money and finances.
*   **The Recommended "Traditional Method" (Ethical Framework):**
    > "70-85% goes to save and used if 100% necessary, and the rest goes all for fun."
    *   This is not a law, but a **cultural ideal** of extreme frugality and long-term security.
    *   **The 70-85% (Save/Necessity Pool):** Covers all true necessities (shelter, nutritious food, healthcare, insurance, tools of trade) and, crucially, massive savings. This savings is for existential emergencies, strategic investment in future capability, or as a buffer against compulsion.
    *   **The 15-30% (Fun/Voluntary Allocation):** All discretionary spending. This is for leisure, luxury, gifts, and voluntary charitable acts—the pure expression of personal joy without compromising security.
    *   **Philosophy:** This method ensures the individual is **invulnerable to coercion** (Pillar 5) because they are financially independent. It maximizes future freedom.

### **C. Military Neddism: Anarchocratic Fascism**

*   **Analog:** A fusion of the core Neddist systems with a stratified security model.
*   **Core Tenet:** Within a Neddist Voluntary Protective Association (VPA), a single, permanent, and highly specialized group is solely authorized to constitute the state's formal military, special operations, and internal defense command. This framework can be applied to either a Publoneddist or Selfoneddist economic base, creating Anarchocratic **Fascio-Communism** and **Fascio-Capitalism**.
*   **Mechanism of Use:**
    1.  **Sole Mandate:** This designated military group holds the exclusive legal right to conduct organized warfare, national defense operations, and high-intensity internal security actions that exceed the proportional self-defense of individual citizens.
    2.  **Civilian Supremacy Under the Pillars:** The military group is **not a ruling junta**. It remains subordinate to the civilian VPA governance and the **Six Pillars**. Its mandate is strictly defensive or responsive to VPA-authorized missions.
    3.  **Voluntary & Meritocratic Composition:** Membership in this group is voluntary and based on extreme merit, psychological fitness, and unwavering commitment to the Neddist doctrine. It is a vocation, not a conscripted duty.
    4.  **Economic Integration:** In **Military Publoneddism (Anarchocratic Fascio-Communism)**, the defense group is a specially designated "steward" of communal defense resources. In **Military Selfoneddism (Anarchocratic Fascio-Capitalism)**, it operates as a supreme, highly-trusted service provider under contract to the VPA and individual sovereigns.
*   **Purpose:** To provide an unmatched, professional, and doctrinally pure defense capability without militarizing the entire society or creating competing armed factions, thereby preserving internal peace and external security with maximum efficiency.

## **IV. Political Structure**

A Neddist polity is a **Voluntary Protective Association (VPA)**.
*   Governance is minimalist, existing solely to:
    1.  Uphold and adjudicate the **Six Pillars**.
    2.  Manage communal resources in **Publoneddism**.
    3.  Enforce contracts and defend against external aggression (a role which may be delegated to the specialized group in **Military Neddism**).
*   Leadership is **meritocratic and recallable**. In Publoneddist VPAs, leaders are top contributors. In Selfoneddist VPAs, they may be hired arbitrators or security providers. In Military Neddism, civilian leadership retains ultimate control over the military mandate.
*   **Exit is always a right.** Any individual or group may secede from the VPA, taking their rightful property (Selfoneddism) or negotiated share of communal assets (Publoneddism).

## **V. Synthesis & Conclusion**

A. (Anarchocratic) Liberalism presents a multi-path system unified by an uncompromising social code:

*   **A. Communism** offers a communitarian life where status and comfort are earned through tangible contribution to the collective.
*   **A. Capitalism** offers a sovereign life of radical self-reliance, where financial discipline is the pathway to ultimate freedom.
*   **A. Facism (Fascio-Communism & Fascio-Capitalism)** provides a specialized, high-trust defense framework compatible with either economic model, ensuring security without sacrificing core liberties.

**The Choice** between them is a choice of social and strategic orientation. All are built on the same foundation: **No justified coercion, only voluntary action. No reward without merit. No justice without dignity and fairness.** This is the world systematized under Anarchocratic Liberalism: a world where your life is yours, your choices are yours, and your worth is determined by what you do, not what you own or profess.
